    <h4>I am a college student at the University of San Diego studying Computer Science and Theatre. My intentions in creating this project were to build something from the ground up with a working UI, functionality, and website. I decided to build this program because about a year ago, I looked for a program like this while writing a history paper, but couldn't find one. I am hoping more people are able to find this more readily available program to assist with writing biographies, papers based on specific people, or buffering multiple inputs with one keypress. I hope you will take the time to give using this program a try!</h4>
